print('Section 1.2 | Problem 28\n', 'Yes.  Think of the 4 quadrants of a plane.  Because vectors need to point in different directions to have negative dot products, 4 vectors in 4 quadrants would be a 0 dot product at least.  But with only three vectors, we just need to pick 3 spaced appropriately.  If you look at the unit circle you can pick (0, 1), (-1/2, √3/2), (-√3/2, -1/2), or any 3 vectors roughly spaced the same amount.')
