# Relationships between types of vectors and arrays

When learning algebra, one of the building blocks is the relationship between different operations.

If you are solving for x, you can work backwards based on the operation that complements the operation you're solving for.

So for `x + 2 = 5`, we know the complementary operation for addition is subtraction, so we can subtract 2 from each side to solve: `x + 2 - 2 = 5 - 2`, `x === 3`.

The same with multiplication and division, `x * 2 = 6`, `(x * 2) / 2 = 6 / 2`, `x === 3`.

When solving for more complex systems, represented by vectors and arrays, similar relationships exist.

R(M) = C(Mᵀ)

𝒩(M) = R(M)⟂ = C(Mᵀ)⟂
null space^
𝒩(Mᵀ) = R(Mᵀ)⟂ = C(M)⟂
left null space^

where V is a subspace of Rⁿ
dim(V) + dim(V⟂) = n



- Singular matrices have a determinant of 0





inner product of a vector is the square root of its length transpose(z)*z=|z|**2
