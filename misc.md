Every matrix that we consider can be thought of as a set of unit vectors with the value of the matrix applied to it.

Take the matrix A
A = [
    [2, 3],
    [2, 1]
]

Do not use the matrix as your mental starting point.

Start with the unit vector.  The thing that the matrix represents is movement applied to this unit vector.
