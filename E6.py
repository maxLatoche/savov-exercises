# I've worked out the logic so the answer is correct by hand
# why is the result of i / a.norm() sqrt(2)/2 instead of 1/sqrt(2)?
# A: sqrt(2)/2 and 1/sqrt(2) are equivalent expressions and represent the same value, but they are represented differently in SymPy because of the way it simplifies fractions.
# In SymPy, the sqrt function returns a symbolic square root, which is not necessarily simplified. When you divide a value by sqrt(2), SymPy will not automatically simplify the fraction to 1/sqrt(2).
# sqrt(2)/sqrt(2) * 1/sqrt(2) == sqrt(2)/sqrt(2)sqrt(2) == sqrt(2)/2
