- transpose(A)B === a ⋅ b (dot product)

Reflecting on the dot product
the dot product is |a||b|cosθ

[the magnitude of a times cosθ gives you the length of a on the span b](images/Dot_Product.svg.png)

Then if you also multiply by the magnitude of b, it scales based on how "strong" b is.

- the intuition of transpose(v)x is that it "gives the amount of" v in x

so for
v = [2, 3]
x = [10, 20]
